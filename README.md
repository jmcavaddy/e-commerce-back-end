# E-commerce Back End

## Description
I created E-commerce Back End to provide vendors an opportunity to compete in a market that seems to favor those with the ability to sell their goods online. In creating this e-commerce back end, I learned more about how to create and maintain RESTful APIs using popular backend technologies. I demonstrate how to implement MySQL2 and Sequelize to connect my Express.js API to a MySQL database and I use the dotenv package to keep the user's MySQL password secure.

## Installation
To install this project and its dependencies you need to first, clone the repo from my GitHub (provided at the bottom of this README.md file). Open up the repo's directory in a command line, and run "npm i" to install dependencies. Now your computer is ready to run e-commerce-back-end.

## Usage
Once you've installed the necessary dependencies, create a .env file that will hold your MySQL credentials for connecting to the database. Run the "schema.sql" file located in the "db" directory to create the database "ecommerce_db". Open up a command line at the root level of the e-commerce-back-end directory, and run the command "npm run seed" to seed "ecommerce_db" with arbitrary data. Then, run the command "npm start" to launch your server. From here, the back end is complete and can be tested using an HTTP client like Insomnia. For a demonstration of the HTTP requests e-commerce-back-end is capable of handling, watch [this video](https://youtu.be/7mBmTcISz8w).
